		/// 1.The Task asynchronous programming model (TAP) provides an abstraction over asynchronous code.
		/// 2.For a parallel algorithm, you'd need multiple cooks (or threads). One would make the eggs, one the bacon, and so on. 
		///	Each one would be focused on just that one task. Each cook (or thread) would be blocked synchronously waiting for bacon to be 
		///	ready to flip, or the toast to pop.
		/// 3.constructing synchronous code to perform asynchronous operations. As written, this code blocks the thread executing it from 
		///	doing any other work. It won't be interrupted while any of the tasks are in progress. It would be as though you stared at the toaster 
		///	after putting the bread in. You'd ignore anyone talking to you until the toast popped.
		/// 4.The await keyword provides a non-blocking way to start a task, then continue execution when that task completes.
		/// 
		/// This code doesn't block while the milk is boiling or Tea is in progress. 
		/// This code won't start any other tasks though. You'd still Cut Vegetables and wait until is is done. 
		/// But at least, you'd respond to anyone that wanted your attention. 
		/// 
		///  > Async improves responsiveness
		///    - Asynchrony proves especially valuable for applications that access the UI thread because all UI-related activity usually shares one thread.
		///    - If any process is blocked in a synchronous application, all are blocked.Your application stops responding, and you might conclude that it has 
		///    failed when instead it's just waiting.
		///  > Threads
		///    - Async methods are intended to be non-blocking operations. An await expression in an async method doesn’t block the current thread while the awaited 
		///    task is running. Instead, the expression signs up the rest of the method as a continuation and returns control to the caller of the async method.
		///    - The async and await keywords don't cause additional threads to be created. Async methods don't require multithreading because an async method doesn't 
		///      run on its own thread. The method runs on the current synchronization context and uses time on the thread only when the method is active. 
		///  > If you specify that a method is an async method by using the async modifier, you enable the following two capabilities.
		///    - The marked async method can use await to designate suspension points.The await operator tells the compiler that the async method can't continue past 
		///      that point until the awaited asynchronous process is complete. In the meantime, control returns to the caller of the async method.
		///      The suspension of an async method at an await expression doesn't constitute an exit from the method, and finally blocks don’t run.
		///    - The marked async method can itself be awaited by methods that call it.
		///  > Async methods can have the following return types:
		///    - Task<TResult>, for an async method that returns a value.
		///    - Task, for an async method that performs an operation but returns no value.
		///    - void, for an event handler.
		///    - Starting with C# 7.0, any type that has an accessible GetAwaiter method
